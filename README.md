# Academic Writeups

As of September 2023 to August 2024 I'll be pursuing a Master's in Data Science (AI, ML, Data Analysis and Visualisation). This is a repo in which I'll be posting the academic writeups that we were tasked with completing over the course of the degree.

## Descriptive Analysis and Visualisation Assignment 1 
The purpose of this report was to take a deeper look into the use of Materialized Views and Dimensional Objects in Data Warehousing in order to understand how it's implementation and integration into OLAP systems help improve their overall performance.

## Descriptive Analysis and Visualisation Assignment 2
This report details one of the ways in which Talend OS can be used (alongside MySQL Workbench) to implement slowly changing dimensions (SCD).

## Technical Project I 
This documents the process of building a model to make predictions to help drivers be aware of highly-dangerous driving situations ahead of time to prompt them to drive more cautiously in light of that foreknowledge.
